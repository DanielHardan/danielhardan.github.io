This is a placeholder file to demonstrate the resume folder functionality.
Once you place actual PDF files in the resume folder, they will be copied to the root of your published site.

To test this:
1. Place your PDF resume files in the 'resume' folder
2. Run 'bundle exec jekyll build' or 'bundle exec jekyll serve'
3. The PDF files will appear in the root of your _site directory

Example: if you place 'john-doe-resume.pdf' in the resume folder, 
it will be accessible at 'https://yoursite.com/john-doe-resume.pdf'
